Static Datepicker UI
This is a simple static Datepicker UI component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It was created as a practice project to improve my skills in:
CSS layout & positioning
Basic UI styling
DOM manipulation in JavaScript
Adding interactivity (popup, date selection, navigation)

Features
✅ Popup calendar that toggles on button click
✅ Month navigation with Prev / Next buttons
✅ Highlight of today’s date (only in current month)
✅ Clicking a date fills the input box
✅ Clicking outside closes the popup

Notes
This project was built following Roadmap.sh Datepicker UI project. https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui
It is not yet connected to dynamic date calculations — no backend or date library (yet).
The goal was to build a UI component as a learning exercise.
