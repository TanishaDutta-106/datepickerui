<h1>Static Datepicker UI</h1>
This is a simple static Datepicker UI component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
It was created as a practice project to improve my skills in:<br>
CSS layout & positioning<br>
Basic UI styling<br>
DOM manipulation in JavaScript<br>
Adding interactivity (popup, date selection, navigation)<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
✅ Popup calendar that toggles on button click <br>
✅ Month navigation with Prev / Next buttons <br>
✅ Highlight of today’s date (only in current month) <br>
✅ Clicking a date fills the input box <br>
✅ Clicking outside closes the popup <br>

<h2>Notes</h2>
This project was built following Roadmap.sh Datepicker UI project. https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui <br>
It is not yet connected to dynamic date calculations — no backend or date library (yet).<br>
The goal was to build a UI component as a learning exercise. <br>
